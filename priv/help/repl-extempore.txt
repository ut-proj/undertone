The Extempore undertone REPL

Built-in functions:

(call body) -- make an explicitly blocking call to Extempore, with 'body' being
               a valid Extempore expression
(exit)      -- alias for '(quit)'
(h)         -- alias for '(help)'
(help)      -- display this information
(quit)      -- quit the Extempore REPL and return to the LFE REPL
(run file)  -- load the code in the given file and run in Extempore
(version)   -- display all the version info for undertone

Extempore support:

All S-expressions other than the ones listed above will be treated as Extempore
Scheme / xtlang code and sent to the Extempore TCP server (compiler service) as
an asynchronous call (no result, no output printed). If you would like to block
on particular calls and see their return values, be sure to use the '(call ...)'
REPL function.
